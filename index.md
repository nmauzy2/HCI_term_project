### Problem: Zoom bombing and other classroom disruptions

Zoom bombing is when someone who is not invited into a zoom meeting joins and then proceeds to cause disruption in the class. This is usually done by sharing an offensive image. This is not limited to only zoom meetings, and can occur on other platforms as well but zoom bombing is one of the most well known forms of disrupting online classes.
  
We are trying to come up with a solution to stop these unwated interruptions in online classrooms. These interruptions are a problem for hybrid classes since they disrupt the online poriton of the class. They can draw attention away from the material that is being taught, or even be so distracting that no one pays attention to the material. This problem affects both teachers and students, it draws attention away from the teacher, and distracts students.  
  
There are some existing solutions that are already integrated into the zoom platform, but we hope to bring these tools to other platforms, and also streamline the process of preventing uninvited users from entering into online meetings and disrupting hybrid classes.
